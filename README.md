What's so new?
--------------

Last year, contributing a visualization to DiMo involved building a
JavaScript-based web renderer from the ground up.  The only shared code was
some re-pasted WebSockets boilerplate.

DiMo 2015 will standardize on a single renderer, with a streamlined approach to
contributions.
